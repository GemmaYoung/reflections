What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git create a hidden directory .git where I create the repository. .git is used to store metadata of files history of my repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a buffer area when transferring files from working directory to repository. It allows you to commit once a couple of files. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Sometimes one logical change concerns more than one file changes. This time staging area could be used to buffer the multiple changes and later commit them all at once.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When I want to keep both origianl and another version of the master branch, which could change the master to some other types or purposes, I need to create new braches other than change on the master itself. That could make the master and non-master branches to advance forward seperately and interact nothing to each other.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams show me if I enter git log which commits would shown up and
if or not can I reach a certain commit.
