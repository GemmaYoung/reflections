1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I want to share my work to other persons I wil create a remote to my local repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I want to pull changes from remote only when the changes occured on the remote have enough meaning, which means there are
often multiple commits to update. If automatically pulling, GitHub will not be able to recognize when or not to pull.
